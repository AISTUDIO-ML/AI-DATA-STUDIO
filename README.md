## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

AI DATA STUDIO is designed with a modular and secure multi-cloud architecture that supports deployment on both Azure and AWS. Below is a high-level overview of its core components:

### 🔧 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Uses Terraform to provision cloud infrastructure on Azure and AWS.
- Ensures reproducibility, version control, and environment consistency.

### ☁️ Azure Deployment Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow (`azure.yml`) automates:
  - Terraform deployment of Confidential VMs and networking
  - AI model deployment to Azure Machine Learning
  - Monitoring setup via Azure Monitor and Log Analytics

### ☁️ AWS Deployment Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow (`aws.yml`) automates:
  - Terraform deployment of Nitro Enclaves and secure VPC
  - AI model deployment to AWS SageMaker
  - Monitoring setup via CloudWatch and IAM roles

### 🧠 AI Model Endpoints
- Models are deployed as secure endpoints:
  - Azure: Managed Online Endpoints via Azure ML
  - AWS: Real-time endpoints via SageMaker

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- Azure: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights
- AWS: CloudWatch metrics, logs, and alarms
- GitHub Actions logs for CI/CD visibility

This architecture ensures scalability, security, and observability across both cloud platforms.
